                Build, buy, and operate multiple businesses from a distance. Liberate yourself
                from the shackles of wage slavery, focusing instead on high-value tasks rather
                than the mundane busywork of day-to-day operations.

                Use technology, people, and systems to work smarter, not harder, and build
                businesses that generate steady income on their own. Once a business becomes
                self-sustaining, move on to the next one, repeat the process and continue to
                expand your portfolio.
